Developing a full stack restaurant management system involves creating both the front-end and back-end components of the application. In this example, we'll create a simple system that includes features for managing menu items, orders, reservations, and customer information. We'll use Node.js for the back-end, Express.js for the server, MongoDB for the database, and React.js for the front-end.

### Tech Stack:
- **Front-end**: React.js
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

### Features:
1. **Authentication**: User login and authentication for staff and admin.
2. **Menu Management**: CRUD operations for menu items.
3. **Order Management**: Create, view, and update orders.
4. **Reservation Management**: Accept and manage reservations.
5. **Customer Management**: Maintain customer information.
6. **Dashboard**: Overview of orders, reservations, and revenue.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Back-end (Node.js & Express.js)

1. **Initialize Node.js Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir restaurant-management-system
   cd restaurant-management-system
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors
   ```

3. **Create Server (server.js)**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

   app.use(express.json());
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
   app.use(cors());

   // Routes
   app.use('/api/auth', require('./routes/auth'));
   app.use('/api/menu', require('./routes/menu'));
   app.use('/api/orders', require('./routes/orders'));
   app.use('/api/reservations', require('./routes/reservations'));
   app.use('/api/customers', require('./routes/customers'));

   app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
   ```

4. **Create Route Files in "routes" folder**:
   - auth.js
   - menu.js
   - orders.js
   - reservations.js
   - customers.js

5. **Implement CRUD Operations in Route Files**:
   - Define routes for authentication, menu items, orders, reservations, and customers.

### Step 2: Setting Up the Front-end (React.js)

1. **Create React App**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app restaurant-client
   cd restaurant-client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install axios react-router-dom
   ```

3. **Folder Structure**:
   - src
     - components
     - pages
     - services
     - App.js
     - index.js

4. **Implement Components**:
   - Login, Register, Dashboard, Menu, Orders, Reservations, Customers, etc.

5. **Implement API Calls with Axios**:
   - Create services for API calls to the back-end.

### Step 3: Setting Up MongoDB

1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Account**:
   - Create a cluster and get connection URI.

2. **Connect Node.js to MongoDB**:
   - Use Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB database.
   - Update server.js file to include the MongoDB connection.

### Step 4: Implement Functionality

1. **Authentication**:
   - Implement login and registration functionality.
   - Use JWT for token-based authentication.

2. **Menu Management**:
   - CRUD operations for adding, editing, and deleting menu items.
   - Store menu items in the database.

3. **Order Management**:
   - Create, view, and update orders.
   - Calculate order totals and store in the database.

4. **Reservation Management**:
   - Accept and manage reservations.
   - Set available times and dates for reservations.

5. **Customer Management**:
   - Store customer information.
   - View customer order history.

6. **Dashboard**:
   - Display statistics such as total revenue, popular menu items, recent orders, etc.

### Step 5: UI/UX Design (Optional)

1. Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Material-UI, or Tailwind CSS for styling.
2. Design user-friendly interfaces for staff and admin panels.
3. Ensure responsive design for mobile devices.

### Step 6: Testing & Deployment

1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
2. Deploy the back-end on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
3. Deploy the front-end on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### Note:
- This example provides a basic structure. You can expand and customize the system based on your requirements.
- Ensure to handle validation, error handling, and security measures like input sanitization and authentication.
- Implement role-based access control for staff and admin functionalities.
  
This is a high-level overview of developing a full-stack restaurant management system. The actual implementation will involve writing a lot of code, handling edge cases, and testing thoroughly.
